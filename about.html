    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>One Direction, also referred to as 1D are an Irish boy band from England and Ireland.
         It began with Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson.
          They finished third on the seventh series of The X Factor.
           They each auditioned for The X Factor separately.
         Simon Cowell put them together in 2010 because he thought they were too good to lose.
         What Makes You Beautiful" was One Direction's first single. 
         After being signed to Syco Music, the group recorded their first album Up All Night.
          Hits on the album include "One Thing" and "Gotta Be You." It was third in the charts.
          They have been very successful since. They tour to places around the world such as Europe, Australia, Asia, and the Americas.

    <p>In 2010, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, and Louis Tomlinson auditioned as solo candidates for the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor.
         They all failed to progress in the "Boys" category at the bootcamp stage of the competition, but were instead put together to form a five-piece boy band, thus qualifying for the "Groups" category.
          Nicole Scherzinger, a guest judge, and Simon Cowell have both claimed to have come up with the idea of forming the band.
           In 2013, Cowell said that it "took him 10 minutes to put them together as a group". Subsequently, the group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice. Styles came up with the name One Direction.
           For their qualifying song at "judges' houses", and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of "Torn". Cowell later commented that their performance convinced him that they "were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well.
           " Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were his final act in the competition. 
        The group quickly gained popularity in the UK</p>
